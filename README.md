# DAO Global Hackathon Submission

## Contrib

### Pain
Coordination within a DAO:s can be complicated and many times it’s hard to get a clear overview of the DAO, it’s domains, members and tasks. Not having a contribution culture where you actively work on turning members into high quality contributors can be limiting to growth and success. As a member contributing to a DAO can feel unorganised and can be hard to know where to start. Many DAO-tools inserts a limitation of how you can run it and the DAO many times needs to adapt to these standards. Lastly the problem with DAO visibility, it can be a challenge to highlight progress, sucesses and who's doing what!

### Target audience
DAOs, the core team and its members
People wanting to contribute, developers, designers, marketers, bis-devs!
Lastly we target people interested in understanding DAO:s curious to start their journey in web3.

### Solution
After being on both sides of the table of contribution. As Discord lurkers, contributing DAO-members and part of core teams - We build a tool that we need, and that we want to use. Without any limits 100% flexible to the DAO:s need! 

We wanted to create a better overview of DAO:s their members, domains and open tasks! To see how funds are allocated and even suggest where you feel contribution is needed.  A new way for DAOs to get their members to start contributing and make it easier for the core team and DAO to decide on future core contributors. 

We’re building next level coordination — where we know every DAO is unique!
